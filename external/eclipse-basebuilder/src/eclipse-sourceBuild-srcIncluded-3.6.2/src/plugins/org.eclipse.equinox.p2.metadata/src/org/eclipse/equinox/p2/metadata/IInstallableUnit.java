/**
 * An installable unit represents an atomic, indivisible unit of installable functionality
 * in a provisioned system. Everything that can be installed or uninstalled in a system, 
 * including both concrete artifacts and instructions describing steps to be performed
 * during install, must be expressed as one or more installable units. Thus the set of
 * installable units present in a system, together with the existing environment 
 * (operating system, etc), completely describes the initial installed state of that system.
 * <p>
 * Installable units may have dependencies on functionality provided by other installable
 * units, such that the unit cannot be installed unless some other installable unit
 * is present in the installed system that provides a matching capability. Such 
 * dependencies are referred to as <i>required capabilities</i>. Conversely,
 * installable units may declared <i>provided capabilities</i>, describing the
 * capabilities that they make available to other units in the system. Note the
 * weak coupling at work here: installable units never directly depend on each other,
 * but instead depend on abstract capabilities that any other installable unit may provide.
 * </p>
