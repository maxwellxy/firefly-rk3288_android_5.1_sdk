Describes high level provisioning operations that can be resolved and performed
either modally or in the background.  
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package consists of several kinds of operations and supporting classes:
<ul>
<li><b>Profile Change Operations</b> describe high level provisioning operations that
modify a profile.  These operations generally are performed in two phases, the resolution
of the operation, followed by the provisioning of the resolved operation.  Both the
resolution and the provisioning tasks can be performed either synchronously or as jobs.
</li>
<li><b>Provisioning Jobs</b> describe lower level provisioning tasks that can
be performed synchronously or in the background.
</li>
<li><b>ProvisioningSession</b> represents a particular instance of a p2 provisioning
system.  It provides access to all of the p2 core services as well as utility methods
for commonly performed provisioning tasks.
</li>
</ul>
